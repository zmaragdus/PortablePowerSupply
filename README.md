<H1> Portable Power Supply </H1>

<H3> Motivation </H3>

This project is aimed at designing a portable power supply for lab work. Commercial benchtop supplies are still quite large, and taking one with you for field testing is rather unwieldy. There is a reasonable need for a smaller portable supply that you can stuff in a backpack. Additionally, this sort of unit would provide a good platform for hobbyists and students.

<H3> Overall Goals </H3>

* The unit should be the size of a large-ish laptop charger.
* The unit should be capable of producing an adjustable output up to 25VDC and 2A (50W).
* OPTIONAL: The unit should provide an auxiliary 5V / 500mA output.

<H3> Organization </H3>

The top-level folder structure shall be divided into four main folders:

* "doc" - documentation
* "hw" - hardware
* "sw" - software
* "mech" - mechanical/assembly

Although system specifications is a sort of documentation, it shall be kept in the root directory.

<H3> Tools </H3>

The system schematic and circuit board will be created in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad-pcb.org).

The microcontroller will be a {UNDETERMINED}, written in {C?}, with {UNDETERMINED} as a compiler and debugger.

Documentation will be created in LaTeX, with images created in Inkscape.
