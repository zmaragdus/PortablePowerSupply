This project is aimed at designing a portable power supply for lab work.

Overall functions / specifications of the system:

* Total size should be that of a large laptop charger
* Total output power should be 25V / 2A on the primary output
* Should have a small display and knobs/wheels/switches for control & adjustment
* Fully isolated from line voltage (120V/60Hz, US / North America)
* OPTIONAL: auxiliary 5V / 500mA output
