<H1> Portable Power Supply </H1>


<H3> Motivation </H3>

This project is aimed at designing a portable power supply for lab work. Commercial benchtop supplies are still quite large, and taking one with you for field testing is rather unwieldly. There is a reasonable need for a smaller portable supply that you can stuff in a backpack.

<H3> Overall Goals </H3>

* The unit should be the size of a large-ish laptop charger.
* The unit should be capable of producing and adjustable output up to 25VDC and 2A.


<H3> Tools </H3>

The system schematic and circuit board will be created in [KiCAD](https://www.kicad-pcb.org).

The microcontroller will be a {UNDETERMINED}, written in {C?}, with {UNDETERMINED} as a compiler and debugger.

General diagrams will be created in {UNDETERMINED}.
